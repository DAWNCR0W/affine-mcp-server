and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `append_block` Step4 types: `database`, `data_view`, `surface_ref`, `frame`, `edgeless_text`, `note`.
- Local integration coverage for all append profiles (`step1`..`step4`) in `scripts/test-append-block-expansion.mjs`.

### Changed
- `append_block` canonical type set expanded to 30 verified cases with stricter field validation and parent-container checks.
- Step4 creation payloads now use Yjs-native value types (`Y.Map`/`Y.Array`) to avoid runtime serialization failures.

### Fixed
- Resolved `Unexpected content type` failures while appending database/edgeless blocks.
- Aligned `surface_ref` caption validation with block creation behavior.
- Prevented AFFiNE UI runtime crashes from `type=data_view` by mapping it to stable `affine:database` output.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- `read_doc` tool to read document block snapshots and plain text via WebSocket.

### Changed
- README now includes Cursor MCP setup examples and explicit troubleshooting for `Method not found` JSON-RPC misuse.
- README now documents that browser local-storage workspaces are not accessible via server APIs.

### Fixed
- Runtime MCP server metadata version in `src/index.ts` updated to `1.4.0`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Open-source community health files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- GitHub community templates: bug/feature issue templates and PR template.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and Dependabot config.
- Tool manifest (`tool-manifest.json`) and static verification script (`npm run test:tool-manifest`).

### Changed
- Tool surface simplified to 31 canonical tools with no duplicated alias names.
- Comprehensive integration test script now validates runtime tool list against `tool-manifest.json`.
- Package metadata improved (`bugs`, `homepage`) and new quality scripts (`npm run ci`, `npm run pack:check`).

### Removed
- Duplicated alias tools (`affine_*`) and low-value/unstable tools from default surface.
- Deprecated `src/tools/updates.ts` and legacy workspace fixed alias tooling.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed
- CLI binary now runs through Node via `bin/affine-mcp`, preventing shells from misinterpreting ESM JS files and avoiding false startup timeouts.

### Changed
- Documentation: removed `.env`-based configuration guidance; recommend environment variables via shell or app configuration.
- Version badges and examples refreshed; clarified non-blocking login default.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-17

### Changed
- Default startup authentication is now asynchronous when using email/password to avoid MCP stdio handshake timeouts. The new env `AFFINE_LOGIN_AT_START` controls behavior (`async` by default, `sync` to block at startup).
- Docs fully refreshed: clear instructions for Codex CLI and Claude Desktop using npm, npx, and local clone workflows.

### Added
- README examples for `codex mcp add` with `affine-mcp` and with `npx -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp`.
- Local clone usage guide and `npm link` workflow.

### Removed
- Unnecessary repo artifacts (e.g., `.env.example`, `.dockerignore`).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-16

### 🚀 Major
Document create/edit/delete is now supported. These are synchronized to real AFFiNE docs via WebSocket (Yjs) updates. Tools: `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, `delete_doc`.

### Added
- WebSocket-based document tools: `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, `delete_doc`
- CLI binary `affine-mcp` for stdio MCP integration (Claude / Codex)
- Tool aliases: support both prefixed (`affine_*`) and non-prefixed names
- Published on npm with a one-line global install: `npm i -g affine-mcp-server`

### Changed
- TypeScript ESM resolution switched to NodeNext for stable `.js` imports in TS
- Docs updated for npm publish and Codex usage

### Fixed
- Unified MCP return types with helper to satisfy SDK type constraints
