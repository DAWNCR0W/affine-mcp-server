# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed
- CLI binary now runs through Node via `bin/affine-mcp`, preventing shells from misinterpreting ESM JS files and avoiding false startup timeouts.

### Changed
- Documentation: removed `.env`-based configuration guidance; recommend environment variables via shell or app configuration.
- Version badges and examples refreshed; clarified non-blocking login default.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-17

### Changed
- Default startup authentication is now asynchronous when using email/password to avoid MCP stdio handshake timeouts. The new env `AFFINE_LOGIN_AT_START` controls behavior (`async` by default, `sync` to block at startup).
- Docs fully refreshed: clear instructions for Codex CLI and Claude Desktop using npm, npx, and local clone workflows.

### Added
- README examples for `codex mcp add` with `affine-mcp` and with `npx -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp`.
- Local clone usage guide and `npm link` workflow.

### Removed
- Unnecessary repo artifacts (e.g., `.env.example`, `.dockerignore`).

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-16

### 🚀 Major
Document create/edit/delete is now supported. These are synchronized to real AFFiNE docs via WebSocket (Yjs) updates. Tools: `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, `delete_doc`.

### Added
- WebSocket-based document tools: `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, `delete_doc`
- CLI binary `affine-mcp` for stdio MCP integration (Claude / Codex)
- Tool aliases: support both prefixed (`affine_*`) and non-prefixed names
- Published on npm with a one-line global install: `npm i -g affine-mcp-server`

### Changed
- TypeScript ESM resolution switched to NodeNext for stable `.js` imports in TS
- Docs updated for npm publish and Codex usage

### Fixed
- Unified MCP return types with helper to satisfy SDK type constraints
